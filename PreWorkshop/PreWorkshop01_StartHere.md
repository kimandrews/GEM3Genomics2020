# **Pre-Workshop:**
# **Introduction and Server Access**


For this workshop we will be doing genomic analyses on servers that are part of the [University of Idaho IBEST Computational Resources Core (CRC)](https://crc.ibest.uidaho.edu/). 

_**Why are we using servers for the workshop?**_

The primary reason for using servers is that genomic analyses usually require a lot more computational power and hard drive space than you have on your desktop or laptop. Also, analyses can take a long time to run, and so your life will be a lot easier if you can run them remotely, rather than waiting days for your analysis to finish before you can close your laptop or restart your desktop.

The CRC servers are useful for genomic analysis because they provide high performance computing and large data storage capacity. Another big advantage of the servers is that they come with many genomic analysis programs pre-installed. Having these programs already installed will save you a lot of time (and headache) dealing with installation yourself.

_**How can I access the servers?**_

For the workshop, you will be assigned a temporary CRC account to access the servers by Benji Oswald, the Director of the CRC. He will also send you instructions for getting on the servers.

Once logged on, you will now be able to use a very powerful computer with a lot of hard drive space by controlling it from your local computer, while using hardly any resources on your local computer. You can enter commands at the command line prompt, and you can also drag and drop files from your local computer to the servers, or vice versa.

_**What do I do next?**_

Prior to the live portion of the workshop, you will be viewing a series of pre-recorded lectures, and following along with the activities, to learn the basics of how to use the Unix command line. Now that you have access to the servers, you’re ready to start. A few words of advice:
1. If possible, your life will be easier if you can use two computer monitors: one to watch the lectures, and the other to do the command line activities on the servers. This will also be true for Day 2 of the live portion of the workshop.
2. Please don’t use the servers for non-workshop activities while you have a temporary account. 
3. If you are already versatile in the Unix command line, you can skip to the very last lecture to learn how to set up your file system on the servers to be ready for the Day 2 live portion of the workshop. This involves creating directories and symlinking the raw data that we will be working with. 

_**Why are we learning about the Unix command line?**_ 

There are many reasons we are learning this:

1. Most bioinformatics programs use Unix command line.
2. Remote servers require the use of Unix command line, and most bioinformatics analyses require the use of remote servers due to the need for high computational power and storage space.
3. Working in the command line makes it much faster and less error-prone to perform repetitive tasks that are often required in bioinformatic analysis, e.g. analyzing many sequence data files in the same way.
4. It is much easier to create a reproducible record of your work when you are working in the command line than when you are working with programs that have a graphic user interface (GUI).

_**But why are we learning about Unix command line on the servers rather than our personal computers?**_

You could do the Unix command line exercises from the pre-recorded lectures on your personal computer, because the exercises don’t require a lot of computational power or space, and don’t require installation of new programs (unless you are using Windows… see below). However, doing the exercises on the servers has several advantages:

1. It gives you practice with using a server, which you will need to use for the Day 2 bioinformatic analyses for the live portion of the workshop (and for your own future research).
2. If we’re all working on the same servers, it makes it easy to share files needed for the activities.
3. If you have a Windows computer, you can’t do the pre-recorded lecture activities on your computer unless you install a Linux/Unix emulator. So if you have a Windows machine, working on the servers will be simpler for learning the Unix command line.
